      <t>
This document introduces a new DNSKEY flag called DELEGATION_ONLY that
indicates that the particular zone will never sign zone data across a
label.  That is, every label (dot) underneath is considered a zone
cut and must have its own (signed) delegation.
<!-- need a sentence like "  DNSSEC Validating
Resolvers can use this bit to ensure the zone never participates in ",
but I can't think of the right ending words yet -Wes -->

     <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
       <t>
       The DNS Security Extensions [DNSSEC] use public key cryptography to
        create an hierarchical trust base with the DNSSEC root public
        keys at the top, followed by Top Level domain (TLD) keys one
        level underneath. While the root and TLD zones are asumed to
        be almost exclusively delegation-only zones, there is
        currently no method to audit these zones to ensure they behave
        as a delegation-only zone. This creates an attractive target
        for malicious use of these zones - either by their owners or
        through coercion. For example, the DNSSEC root key could
        simply sign an A record and TLSA record for "www.example.com",
        overriding the authority of "com" and "example.com". If such a
        change is done in a targetted attack, the attack would be near
        impossible to detect without prior knowledge of what zone contents
        are legitimate within a given zone.

        
        This document defines a
        mechanism for zone owners, at DNSKEY creation time, to indicate
        they will only delegate the remainder of the tree to
        lower-level zones, allowing easier logging and auditing of DNS
        responses they serve.
        </t>
        <t>
       This document introduces a new DNSKEY flag allowing zone owners
       to commit that the zone will never sign
       any DNS data that traverses a single label and if any such
       signed data is encountered by validating resolvers, that this
       data should be interpreted as BOGUS.
        </t>
      </section>
  
      <section title="Terminology" anchor="terminology">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119">RFC&nbsp;2119</xref>.</t>
      </section>


<section title="The Deep Link State problem">
  <t>
The hierarchical model of DNS and DNSSEC (<xref target="RFC4033"/>, <xref target="RFC4034"/>
and <xref target="RFC4035"/>) comes with the property that a zone at one
point in the hierarchy can define, and therefor override, everything in
the DNS tree from their point and below. For example, the DNSSEC root key could ignore
the NS records for ".org" and "example.org" and could place a record
"www.example.org" directly into its own zone, with a corresponding RRSIG
signed by the root key itself. Even if resolvers would defend against this
attack by not allowing RRSIG's to span across a potential zone cut, the zone
operator (any level higher in the hierarchy than the target victim)
could briefly remove the NS and DS records, and create a "legitimate" DNS
entry for "www.example.org", hiding the normal zonecuts.
The attacker can then publish DNS addresses records (e.g. A and AAAA
records), as well as records used for authentication (e.g. TLSA, SMIME, OPENPGPKEY, SSHP or
IPSECKEY records).
 </t>
 <t>
Exposing such targetted attacks requires a transparency audit setup
(<xref target="RFC6962" />) that needs to
log all signed DNS data to prove that data signed by a parental DNSKEY was out of
expected policy.  The very distributed nature of DNS makes such transparency logs
prohibitively expensive and nearly impossible to operate. Additionally, it would
expose all zone data <!-- why? -wes --> to any public log operators, thereby exposing all DNS data
to a public archive. This data could then be used for other malicious purposes.
 </t>
</section>

<section title="Limiting the scope of a DNSKEY RRset to just delegations">
<t>
This document introduces a new DNSKEY flag called DELEGATION_ONLY. When
this flag is set on a DNSKEY with SEP bit set (KSK), the zone owner commits
to not sign any data that crosses a label down in the hierarchy. This
commits a parent in the DNS hierarchy to only sign NS and DS records 
(i.e. all non-glue, delegation records) for its child zones. It will no longer be
able to ignore (or briefly delete, see below) a child delegation and publish
data crossing zone labels by pretending the next label is not a zone cut.
</t>
<t>
For such a parent to take over data that belongs to its child zone, it has
two choices. It can (temporarilly) remove its own DNSKEY DELEGATION_ONLY
flag or it can replace the NS and DS records of its child zone with its
own data (destinations and key references) so it can sign DNS data that
belongs to its own child zone. However, both of these actions cannot be hidden,
thus exposing such malicious behavior when combined with public
transparency logs.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Parental Transparency">
<t>
A parent zone, such as the root zone, a TLD or any public suffix list
delegation point, that has published a key with the
DELEGATION_ONLY flag can no longer make an exception for a single delegated
zone without removing the DELEGATION_ONLY flag, switching off its
published policy.
This action would be highly visible, and for some domains such as the root
or TLDs, require human interaction to notify the stake holders to
prevent loss of trust.
</t>
<t>
Removing the DELEGATION_ONLY flag from a DNSKEY requires that the zone
signals a new DS record to its parent, as changing any DNSKEY flag
requires changes to the DS record data for that corresponds to it.
</t>
<t>
In the case of the root key, it would require updating out-of-band root
key meta information and/or perform an <xref target="RFC5011"/> style
rollover for the same key with updated DNSKEY flags. Due to the timings of
such a rollover, it would take at least 30 days for the first validating resolvers
to even pick this policy change. It would also be a highly visible event.
</t>
<t>
Replacing the NS and DS records of a child zone can still be done in
a targetted attack mode, but these events are something that can be
easilly tracked by a transparency infrastructure similar to what is now
in use for the WebPKI using <xref target="RFC6962"/>(bis). With client
implementations of transparency, all records would be logged and become visible
to the owner of attacked child zones, exposing a parent's malicious
actions.
</t>
</section>


<section title="Marking the root key DELEGATION_ONLY">
<t>
Once the root key is marked with a DELEGATION_ONLY flag, and deployed
resolvers are configured with the new key,
all TLDs
will be ensured that the root key can no longer be abused to create "deep link"
data. Until the root key sets this bit, software MAY imply this bit is always
set, as this is the current expectation of the root zone.
</t>
</section>
<section title="Marking TLD keys DELEGATION_ONLY">
<t>
Even before the root key has been marked with DELEGATION_ONLY, TLDs can already
signal their own willingness to commit being DELEGATION_ONLY zones.
Any changes of that state in a TLD DNSKEY will require those TLDs to submit a new DS
record to the root.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Migrating to and from DELEGATION_ONLY">
<t>
There might be multiple DNSKEYs with the SEP bit set in a zone. For the purpose of
delcaring a zone as DELEGATION_ONLY, only those DNSKEY's that have a corresponding
DS record at the parent MUST be considered. If multiple DS records appear at the
parent, some of which point to DNSKEY's with and some of which point to DNSKEY's
without the DELEGATION_ONLY flag set, the zone MUST be considered DELEGATION_ONLY.
This situation will occur when a zone is rolling its DNSKEY key at the same time
as it is commiting to a DELEGATION_ONLY zone (or the reverse).
</t>
</section>

<section title="Similarities to the Public Suffix List" anchor="thirdparty">
<t>
<!-- this section doesn't seem to have a point -->
The DELEGATION_ONLY flag has a strong overlap in functionality with the
Public Suffix List; both signal a formal split of authority between parent
and child.  The DELEGATION_ONLY flag allows zones to formally state
their intention.
</t>
</section>
<section title="Operational Considerations" anchor="operations">
<t>
Setting or unsetting the DELEGATION_ONLY flag must be handled like any other Key
Signing Key rollover procedure, with the appropriate wait times to give resolvers
the chance to update their caches.
</t>
<t>
Some TLDs offer a service where small domains can be hosted in-zone at the TLD zone
itself. In that case, the TLD MUST NOT set the DELEGATION_ONLY flag. Another
solution for such TLDs is to create delegations for these child zones with the
same or different DNSKEY as used in the parent zone itself.
</t>
<t>
If a zone is publishing glue records for a number of zones, and the
zone that contains the authoritative records for this glue is deleted,
a resigning of the zone will make this orphaned glue authoritative within
the zone. However, with the DELEGATION_ONLY bit set, this (signed) DNSSEC
data will be considered BOGUS as it violations the commitment to only
delegate. This may impact domains that depended on this unsigned glue.
</t>
<t>For example, if "example.com" and "example.net" use NS records pointing to "ns.example.net",
then if "example.net" is deleted from the ".net" zone, and the previously unsigned glue of
"ns.example.net" is now signed by the ".net" zone, the "example.com" zone will lose
its NS records and fail to resolve.
</t>
<t>The bind DNS software has an option called "delegation_only zones" which is an option
that means something completely different. It refers to ignoring wildcard records in
specified zones that are deemed delegation-only zones.
