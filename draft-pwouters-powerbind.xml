      <t>
This document introduces a new DNSKEY flag called DELEGATION_ONLY that
indicates that the particular zone will never sign zone data aside
from records at the apex of the zone or delegation records for its
children. That is, every label (dot) underneath is considered a zone
cut and must have its own (signed) delegation. DNSSEC Validating
Resolvers can use this bit to mark any data that violates the
DELEGATION_ONLY policy as BOGUS.

     <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
       <t>
       The DNS Security Extensions [DNSSEC] use public key cryptography to
        create a hierarchical trust base with the DNSSEC root public
        keys at the top, followed by Top Level domain (TLD) keys one
        level underneath. While the root and TLD zones are asumed to
        be almost exclusively delegation-only zones, there is
        currently no interoperable and automatable mechanism
        for auditing these zones to ensure they behave
        as a delegation-only zone. This creates a target
        for malicious use of these zones - either by their owners or
        through coercion. 
       </t>
       <t>
        This document defines a mechanism for zone owners to create
        DNSKEY that indicate they will only delegate the remainder of
        the DNS tree to lower-level zones.  This allows for easier
        delegation policy verification, logging and auditing of DNS
        responses served by their infrastructure.
        </t>
        <t>
       Specifically, this document introduces a new DNSKEY flag
       allowing zone owners to commit to only signing records relating
       to delegation.  If a DNSSEC validator discovers any
       non-delegation zone data signed by a flagged key, this data
       can be interpreted as BOGUS.
        </t>

	      capitals, as shown here.
	      </t>
      </section>


<section title="The Deep Link State problem">
  <t> The hierarchical model of DNS and DNSSEC (<xref
  target="RFC1034" />, <xref target="RFC1035" />, <xref
  target="RFC4033" />, <xref target="RFC4034" /> and <xref
  target="RFC4035"/>) comes with the property that a zone at one point
  in the hierarchy can define, and therefor override, everything below
  it in the DNS tree. And this is possible to achieve on a per-client
  basis.
  </t>
  <t> For example, the owner of the DNSSEC root key could generate a
  specially crafted zone file that ignores the intended NS records for
  ".org" and "example.org".  It could place a AAAA record for
  "www.example.org" directly into the specially crafted zone, with a
  corresponding RRSIG signed by the root DNSKEY itself.  Validating
  resolvers would find this record perfectly acceptable, as it was
  signed by a key within the proper chain of trust (in this case, a
  root DNSKEY).  This specially crafted zone could then even be served
  to specific customers in an effort to subvert a portion of the DNS
  ecosystem.</t>

  <t>Similarly, the TLD "example" could circumvent
  company.example for certain customers.  It is important to note that
  this can be done without changing the upstream DS record or trust
  anchor -- the DNSKEY is (again) already in the trust path and is merely
  signing deeper DNS records than the zone owner's clients may have
  expected it to sign.</t>

  <t>It is important to note that this "feature" has always been
  present.  Since the creation of the DNS, it has always been possible
  to server "split zones".  Specifically, it's not a fault of DNSSEC
  -- DNSSEC was not designed to protect against this use case.</t>

<t>[Wes note: we should switch to .example as the TLD instead of
including .org in the chain with a problem; leaving it as is for now]</t>

<!--
<t> Old text that is hard to parse; leaving it for now maybe trying to
wrap it in:
Even if resolvers
would defend against this attack by not allowing RRSIG's to span
across a potential zone cut, the zone operator (any level higher in
the hierarchy than the target victim) could briefly remove the NS and
DS records, and create a "legitimate" DNS entry for "www.example.org",
hiding the normal zone cuts.  The attacker can then publish DNS
addresses records (e.g. A and AAAA records), as well as records used
for authentication (e.g. TLSA, SMIME, OPENPGPKEY, SSHP or IPSECKEY
records).
 </t>
-->

<t>
Exposing such targeted attacks would require transparency audit
infrastructure similar to what is deployed for PKIX (<xref
target="RFC6962" />).  However, a DNSSEC version would need to log significantly
more data, as all signed DNS data used by a DNSKEY must be recorded in
order to prove that data signed by a parent zone's DNSKEY was out of
expected policy. The very distributed nature of the DNS combined with the
typically frequent zone resigning rate makes such
transparency logs prohibitively expensive and nearly impossible to
operate.</t>

<t>Additionally, it would require zone owners to expose all
their zone data to any public log operators, thereby introducing
privacy implications and exposing all relevant DNS data to a public
archive. Though this may be acceptable for some domains, such as the
root, where DNS data is already considered public.  However, other
delegation domains have legal implications that prohibit them from
participating in such a system.
</t>

<t>Furthermore, there is no signaling mechanism that lets validating
resolvers know what must be logged.  Today there are over 1500 TLDs in
the root zone, some of which may be considered delegation-only while
others may not be.  At the time of this writing, the list of entries
in the public suffix list contains over 8800 entries as well, 73 are
wild-card entries (prefixed with a "*") indicating that all of their
(unknown number of) children are public registration points.  In the
absence of an interoperable mechanism (like this draft provides),
it is infeasible that a validating resolver or auditing log could know
which of these zones are delegation-only without individual policy
statements from each of them.  [todo: xref psl] are expected to be
delegation only
</t>

<section title="Affected parties and their roles">

<t>Upon deployment of this specification, the following parties would be
potentially affected:</t>

<t>Authoritative parent: If (and only if) an authoritative parent is
a "delegation only" zone, it could generate a DNSKEY with the
DELEGATION_ONLY bit set, indicating a verifiable promise to the world
that will not sign any records other than delegation records.</t>

<t>Authoritative Child / Delegated Zone: child zones existing
underneath a marked delegation-only zone get the added benefit of
knowing their parent will not (and cannot) sign DNS records within the
child's portion of the DNS tree using the marked DNSKEY.</t>

<t>Validating Resolver: A validating that supports verifying the
DELEGATION_ONLY bit is capable of rejecting or discarding any data
from an authoritative parent that incorrectly signs non-delegation
records too low in the DNS tree.  If the validating resolver supports
a (future-defined) DNSSEC transparency audit log as well, it may
submit the appropriate data to a DNSSEC transparency log that
appropriately tracks DNSSEC signatures.</t>

<t>DNSSEC Transparency Log (optional): a DNSSEC transparency log would create a
non-modifiable trace of log entries submitted to it, for public
verification, similar to <xref target="RFC6962" />.  What it chooses
to accept into its log might be only certain zone data, or any zone
with a marked DNSKEY.</t>

<t>Note that without a DNSSEC Log, the DELEGATION_ONLY bit is still
useful per the discussion in the Validating Resolvers role: the
resolver will reject incorrectly signed, non-delegation data.
However, malicious parent zones are still capable of creating two (or
more) DNSKEYs, one with the DELEGATION_ONLY flag and one without.
However, they would also have to have and publish a DS record as well,
which is likely detectable by any DNSSEC monitoring platforms,
regardless of the existence of a DNSSEC Transparency Log.  Any zone
with multiple DS records that link to both a DELEGATION_ONLY marked
and an unmarked DNSKEY would be considered suspicious.  Circumventing
this through obfuscation would require the collusion of their parent
as well.  Finally, a DELEGATION_ONLY flag DNSKEY for the root zone
cannot be overridden easily, as it would require a trust anchor update
in all validating resolvers.</t>

<section title="The DELEGATION_ONLY DNSKEY flag">
<t>
This document introduces a new DNSKEY flag called DELEGATION_ONLY. When
this flag is set on a DNSKEY with its Secure Entry Point (SEP) bit
set - that is the DNSKEY is a Key Signing Key (KSK) - the zone owner
commits to not sign any data aside from its records at the apex of the
zone and delegation records for its children. This commits a parent in
the DNS hierarchy to only publish signed DS records and unsigned glue
records (NS and A/AAAA) for its child zones. It will no longer be able
to ignore (or briefly delete, see below) a child delegation and publish
data beyond its own label by pretending the next label is not a zone cut.
</t>
<!-- one implication: a zone supporting this must place its own NS
     record referrals into sub-zones (or other zones) -->
<t>
For such a parent to take over data that belongs to its child zone, it has
two choices. It can (temporarily) remove its own DNSKEY DELEGATION_ONLY
flag or it can replace the NS and DS records of its child zone with its
own data (destinations and key references) so it can sign DNS data that
belongs to its own child zone. However, both of these actions cannot be hidden,
thus exposing such malicious behavior when combined with DNSSEC
Transparency logs.
</t>

     <section title="_underscore label exception">
     <t>Some protocols, such as the DANE protocol <xref
     target="RFC6698"/> use a number of labels that start with an
     underscore (_) prefix to publish information about the zone
     itself. For example, the TLSA record for example.com is published
     at the location _443._tcp.example.com. These records are
     semantically part of the zone itself and are not delegated child
     zones. Any chain of labels consisting of only labels each
     starting with an underscore (_) under the apex of the zone is not
     considered to violate the DELEGATION_ONLY flag limitation of
     being DELEGATION_ONLY, as this data is logically part of the zone
     itself and is never meant to be interpreted as an independent
     delegated child zone.</t>
     </section>

     <section title="Parent Zone Transparency">
     <t>
     A parent zone, such as the root zone, a TLD or any public suffix list
     delegation point, that has published a key with the DELEGATION_ONLY
     flag can no longer make an exception for a single delegated zone without
     removing the DELEGATION_ONLY flag, switching off its published policy.
     This action would be highly visible, and for some domains such as the
     root or TLDs, require human interaction to notify the stake holders to
     prevent loss of trust.
     </t>
     <t>
     Removing the DELEGATION_ONLY flag from a DNSKEY requires that the zone
     first publishes an additional updated DS record to its parent.
     </t>
     <t>
     In the case of the root key, it would require updating out-of-band root
     key meta information and/or performing an <xref target="RFC5011"/> style
     rollover for the same key with updated DNSKEY flags. Due to the timings of
     such a rollover, it would take at least 30 days for the first validating resolvers
     to process this policy change. It would also be a highly visible event.
     </t>
     <t>
     Replacing the NS and DS records of a child zone can still
     be done in a targeted attack by a parent, but these events
     are something that can be easily tracked by a transparency
     infrastructure similar to what is now in use for the WebPKI using
     <xref target="RFC6962"/>(bis). With client implementations of
     transparency, all DELEGATION_ONLY flag changes would be logged and
     become visible to the owner of attacked child zones, exposing a
     parent's malicious actions.
     </t>
     </section>
     
     <section title="Marking the Root DNSKEY DELEGATION_ONLY">
     <t>
     Once the Root DNSKEY is marked with a DELEGATION_ONLY flag and deployed
     resolvers are configured with the new DNSKEY, all TLDs will be assured
     that the Root DNSKEY can no longer be abused to override child zone data.
     Until the Root KSK DNSKEY sets this bit, software SHOULD imply this bit is
     always set, as this is the current expectation of the Root Zone.
     </t>
     </section>

     <section title="Migrating to and from DELEGATION_ONLY">
     <t>
     There might be multiple DNSKEYs with the SEP bit set in a
     zone. For the purpose of declaring a zone as DELEGATION_ONLY,
     only those DNSKEY's that have a corresponding DS record at the
     parent MUST be considered. If multiple DS records appear at the
     parent, some of which point to DNSKEY's with the DELEGATION_ONLY
     flag set and some of which point to DNSKEY's without the
     DELEGATION_ONLY flag set, the zone MUST be considered
     DELEGATION_ONLY. This situation will occur when a zone is
     rolling its DNSKEY key at the same time as it is committing to a
     DELEGATION_ONLY zone (or the reverse). During the overlap, the
     zone is considered to be a delegation-only zone.
     </t>
     </section>

     <section title="Allowed record types for labels inside
                     DELEGATION_ONLY zones">
                     <t>Some labels within a DELEGATION_ONLY marked
                     zone must be published by a parent in order to
                     properly sign its zone and its child's referral
                     data. Thus, any published and signed zone data
                     deeper than the zone apex MUST only include DNS
                     TYPEs of glue (NS, A and AAAA), DS, NSEC and
                     NSEC3 records.</t>
     </section>


</section>

<section title="Operational Considerations" anchor="operations">
<t>
Setting or unsetting the DELEGATION_ONLY flag must be handled like any
other Key Signing Key rollover procedure, with the appropriate wait
times to give resolvers the chance to update their caches.
</t>
<t>
Some TLDs offer a service where small domains can be hosted in-zone at the
TLD zone itself. In that case, the TLD MUST NOT set the DELEGATION_ONLY
flag. Another solution for such TLDs is to create delegations for these
child zones with the same or different DNSKEY as used in the parent
zone itself.
</t>
<t>
Zones setting the DELEGATION_ONLY flag can no longer publish
non-delegation records in their zone. That means that for those RRTYPEs
that take DNS targets as parameters (NS, MX, SRV, ...), the targets
cannot have their own host names on the zone. Instead, a sub-zone needs
to be created to place those targets in. If "example.com" has an NS
record pointing to "ns0.example.com", this entry needs to be moved to
a sub-zone such as ns0.nic.example.com before the zone can be switched
to DELEGATION_ONLY. Otherwise, the signed record "ns0.example.com"
would be interpreted as the parent's hostile takeover of the child zone
"ns0.example.com". Similarly, an MX target pointing to "mail.example.com"
would have to be moved to a sub-zone, such as "mail.nic.example.com". The
zone "nic.example.com" MUST NOT be made DELEGATION_ONLY in that case,
otherwise it would have the exact same problem.
</t>
<t>
If a zone is publishing glue records for a number of zones, and the
zone that contains the authoritative records for this glue is deleted,
a resigning of the zone will make this orphaned glue authoritative within
the zone. However, with the DELEGATION_ONLY bit set, this (signed) DNSSEC
data will be considered BOGUS as it violations the commitment to only
delegate. This may impact domains that depend on these incorrect glue records.
</t>
<t>
For example, if "example.com" and "example.net" use NS records pointing to
"ns.example.net", then if "example.net" is deleted from the ".net" zone,
and the previously unsigned glue of "ns.example.net" is now signed by the
".net" zone, the "example.com" zone will lose its NS records and fail
to resolve.
</t>
<t>
The bind DNS software has an option called "delegation_only zones"
which is an option that means something completely different. It
refers to ignoring wildcard records in specified zones that are deemed
delegation-only zones.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Security Considerations" anchor="security">
<t>
Some parent zone attacks cannot be detected when the validating resolver's
cache is empty. Care should be taken by resolvers to not unnecessarily
empty their cache. This is specifically important for roaming clients
that re-connect frequently to different wireless or mobile data networks.
</t>
<t>
The DELEGATION_ONLY DNSKEY flag is only valid for DNSKEY's that have
the SEP bit set. It MUST be ignored on DNSKEY's without the SEP bit set.
</t>
<t>This DELEGATION_ONLY mechanism is not designed to completely foil
attacks (since parent's can simply change a child's referral data),
but rather to empower transparency logging mechanisms.</t>
</section>

<section title="Privacy Considerations" anchor="privacy">
<t>
Some of the protection offered by the DELEGATION_ONLY flag is only
available when DNS resolvers report changes in the signing depth of high
level (root or TLD) DNSKEYs to gain DNSSEC Transparency. This reporting
can reveal that a particular node is trying to access a certain DNS
name. Defensive measures to prevent exposing users should be taken when
implementing DNSSEC Transparency. It is expected that DNSSEC Transparency
behaviour will be written up in a separate document.
<!-- we should mention query minimization here -->
</t>
</section>

<section title="Human Rights Considerations" anchor="humanrights">
<t>
The DNS protocol's hierarchy limits zones authority to themselves and
their child zones only. While this provides a finer grained trust model
compared to a simple list of all-powerful trusted entities, such as those
used in the WebPKI, it consolidates a lot of power in the few keys at
the top of the DNS hierarchy. With the increased reliance on DNSSEC for
securely identifying resources, such as DANE records, it is important to
monitor and audit the keys at the top of the DNS hierarchy to prevent
their abuse and coercion of child zones. This DNS protocol extension
specifically aims at increasing parent zone transparency and blocks some
parent zone attacks from those parents who have publicly claimed to never
override their child zone data and thus increases the security and
stability of DNS and DNSSEC.
</t>
<t>
Zones publishing the DELEGATION_ONLY flag to increase their public trust
are still able to remove child zones from their zone, for example in
cases of legal compliance or to prevent malicious activity happening
in its child zones. But these parents can only do so publicly and
can no longer surreptitiously take control of their own child zones.
This protocol extension does not limit legal enforcement of child zones
by their parent zones other than making it visible for everyone when a
childzone is legally taken over for compliance or legal reasons.
